  storyText: "This bunker looks like it goes on forever. Up ahead I see one sniper
    tower\nand a lone sniper up top.\n\nHeavily armored but he could miss if I run
    fast enough. I could also stick back and try\nto surprise him from afar.\n\nWhat
    should I do?\n    1. Rush the sniper tower hoping he misses at close range.\n   
    2. Stay back and try to surprise him."
