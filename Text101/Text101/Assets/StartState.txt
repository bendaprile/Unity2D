This bunker looks like it goes on forever. Up ahead I see one sniper tower
and a lone sniper up top.

Heavily armored but he could miss if I run fast enough. I could also stick back and try
to surprise him from afar.

What should I do?
    1. Rush the sniper tower hoping he misses at close range.
    2. Stay back and try to surprise him.
